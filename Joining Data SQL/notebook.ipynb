These operations include UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT. Each operation has its own specific use and rules for application:\n\n- `UNION` combines the results of two SELECT queries into a single result set, including all distinct rows from both queries. If there are duplicate rows in the results of the two queries, UNION will return only one instance of each duplicate row.\n\n- `UNION ALL` is similar to UNION, but it includes all rows from both SELECT queries, including duplicates. This can be useful when you need to maintain the count of duplicate records.\n\n- `INTERSECT` returns only the rows that are present in the result sets of both SELECT queries. In other words, it finds the common rows between the two queries.\n\n- `EXCEPT` (or `MINUS` in some databases) returns rows from the first SELECT query that are not present in the result set of the second SELECT query. It effectively subtracts the results of the second query from the first.\n\nEach of these operations can be used to manipulate and analyze data across multiple tables or within the same table, depending on the query's requirements.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c8398c06-7fea-4fcf-8c35-703ee852e4f3"},{"source":"*UNION*","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ed5211e3-16c7-4e0d-be9d-ed668bedd6d5"},{"source":"--

**Semi-Join**","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3003dfe0-46a9-4308-99b6-42266fdfa536"},{"source":"A **Semi Join** in SQL is a type of join that is used to return rows from the left table only if there is at least one matching row in the right table. It is similar to an `INNER JOIN`, but the difference is that a semi join does not include columns from the right table in the result set. Instead, it only checks for the existence of matching rows in the right table to determine which rows to return from the left table.\n\nThe main purpose of a semi join is to filter the rows of the first table based on whether or not a relationship exists in the second table, without actually retrieving any data from the second table. This can be particularly useful for checking existence or for queries where you are only interested in the data from one table but need to filter based on the presence of related data in another table.\n\nSQL does not explicitly have a `SEMI JOIN` keyword. Instead, semi joins are typically implemented using `IN`, `EXISTS`, or a combination of `JOIN` and `DISTINCT` clauses.\n\nKey Points:\n- Returns rows from the first (left) table where at least one matching row is found in the second (right) table.\n- Does not return any columns or data from the second (right) table.\n- Useful for existence checks and filtering based on relationships.\n- Implemented using `IN`, `EXISTS`, or a combination of `JOIN` and `DISTINCT` clauses, as SQL does not have a specific `SEMI JOIN` keyword.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2ddf8e03-dde7-4ebe-a068-434e61ce273c"},{"source":"-- Selecting the unique country names where the region is Middle East\nSELECT DISTINCT name\nFROM

A subquery inside a `WHERE` clause is used to filter records based on a condition that involves another query. This enables dynamic filtering of records where the condition isn't static but depends on the outcome of another query. For instance, it can be used to filter records that match or do not match another set of records in a different table.\n\nOn the other hand, subqueries within the `SELECT` clause are used to return specific data for each row from a separate query. This is often utilized to add additional columns to the results where each row includes data derived from another table, based on a relation defined in the subquery. This allows for the inclusion of aggregated data, such as counts or sums, from related tables directly alongside the main query's results.\n\nBoth types of subqueries enhance the flexibility and
